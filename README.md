# Minesweeper
Here is my version of Minesweeper.
I tried to make my version of this game in JavaScript, just to present any project, fully written in JS.
This include 3 original difficulty levels (Beginner, Advanced and Master) just as custom map settings.
There is also basic score system and bomb counts (marking bombs feature is also there).
